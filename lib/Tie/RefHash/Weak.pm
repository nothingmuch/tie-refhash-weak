=head1 NAME

Tie::RefHash::Weak - A Tie::RefHash subclass with weakened references in the keys.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Tie::RefHash::Weak;
	tie my %h, 'Tie::RefHash::Weak';

	# OR:

	use Tie::RefHash::Weak 'fieldhash';
	fieldhash my %h;

	{ # new scope
		my $val = "foo";

		$h{\$val} = "bar"; # key is weak ref
	
		print join(", ", keys %h); # contains \$val, returns regular reference
	}
	# $val goes out of scope, refcount goes to zero
	# weak references to \$val are now undefined

	keys %h; # no longer contains \$val

	# see also Tie::RefHash

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The L<Tie::RefHash> module can be used to access hashes by reference. This is
useful when you index by object, for example.

The problem with L<Tie::RefHash>, and cross indexing, is that sometimes the
index should not contain strong references to the objects. L<Tie::RefHash>'s
internal structures contain strong references to the key, and provide no
convenient means to make those references weak.

This subclass of L<Tie::RefHash> has weak keys, instead of strong ones. The
values are left unaltered, and you'll have to make sure there are no strong
references there yourself.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

For compatibility with L<Hash::Util::FieldHash>, this module will, upon
request, export the following two functions. You may also write
C<use Tie::RefHash::Weak ':all'>.

=over 4

=item fieldhash %hash

This ties the hash and returns a reference to it.

=item fieldhashes \%hash1, \%hash2 ...

This ties each hash that is passed to it as a reference. It returns the
list of references in list context, or the number of hashes in scalar
context.

=back

=head1 THREAD SAFETY

L<Tie::RefHash> version 1.32 and above have correct handling of threads (with
respect to changing reference addresses). If your module requires
Tie::RefHash::Weak to be thread aware you need to depend on both
L<Tie::RefHash::Weak> and L<Tie::RefHash> version 1.32 (or later).

Version 0.02 and later of Tie::RefHash::Weak depend on a thread-safe version of
Tie::RefHash anyway, so if you are using the latest version this should already
be taken care of for you.

=head1 5.10.0 COMPATIBILITY

Due to a minor change in Perl 5.10.0 a bug in the handling of magic freeing was
uncovered causing segmentation faults.

This has been patched but not released yet, as of 0.08.

=head1 CAVEAT

You can use an LVALUE reference (such as C<\substr ...>) as a hash key, but
due to a bug in perl (see
L<http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=46943>) it might not be 
possible to weaken a reference to it, in which case the hash element will 
never be deleted automatically.
